Pre-set:
(SNR > 3) / (SNR_total)  >= 0.1 : 
compare result: integrate r = 0~inf and r = 1~inf, see training sample, get (SNR > 3) / (SNR_total)  minimum should be ~0.2

limit phi bins of len <= 5:
see 3sig vs. UNCfound unnecessary by comparison. 

test if 3 sig limit is resonablt:
found non-sig works better.
